# Seizure Onset Prediction Using Classical Machine Learning
This repository contains the full pipeline for a seizure onset prediction project using EEG data from the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database. The project implements preprocessing, feature extraction, and training of classical machine learning models to distinguish seizure from non-seizure EEG segments.

# ðŸ“š Project Description
Seizure detection is critical for improving clinical care and automated monitoring of patients with epilepsy. This project focuses on predicting seizure onset using 2-second EEG signal windows. We use a classical machine learning pipeline, based on the method in Shoeb & Guttag (2010), extracting spectral energy features from band-specific EEG signals. The final models are trained on a balanced dataset with extreme class imbalance mitigation.

This project was completed as a final assignment for the workshop course on Data Science in Neuroscience.
